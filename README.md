CS106B
======

This folder contains the programming assignments from Stanford University course CS106B: Programming Abstractions in 
c++ taught by Julie Zelenski. The materials for the course can be downloaded from: 
http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=11f4f422-5670-4b4c-889c-008262e09e4e

My solutions will sometimes use the Stanford libraries that have been written to help along with the course and sometimes 
I will use standard c++ libraries. The Stanford libraries can also be downloaded from the above link.
